2.layered background (background /foreground), at least one image, and a player-controlled sprite
an balloon sprite with automatic movement
3.the ability for the player to shoot pins at the enemy
4.collision detection of pins, using tags so that a player does not pop himself with his own bullets
5.sound effect on collisions
6.displayed score for player
7.increasing size of balloon and impact on score
8.at least one distractor
9.at least three levels in increasing order of difficulty. Document the difficulty of each level in the directions.
10.scene transitions: Every time that your player pops the balloon, the game should transition to the next level. Every time the balloon gets too big and disappears, the current level should be restarted. OR a slightly different version that you chose to implement.
11.Clear directions (include the basics of each level
12.settings, including a volume setting with a slider
13.menu
14.pause/resume and link back to menu
15.some other UI (dropdown, toggle, input)
16.a data item that persist from scene to scene
17.a second data item that persists
18.high scores (at least 5, presented in order)
19.animation #1
20.animation #2
21.Extra credit: difficulty selection by player (with documentation about difficulty)

Please make sure that your game has links back to the menu on each scene, for easy navigation. 

The game submission is due on Saturday, December 7 at 11:59 PM. It is worth 22 points, one point for each of the components on the list above as well as two points for general game and UI design. You must write a short description of your game design to get credit for those two points. (What design decisions did you make and why? What is unique about your game? What are you most proud of in your game? You don't have to answer all, but explain why your game looks the way it does.)

Together with your submission, you   must include a document (in PDF format) that checks off the components and says where to find them in the game if relevant (not in the code, but in the game. Be specific about which scene has which items. For example, which image do you have? what animations? which data items persist?)  If you do not have any component on the list above, please note so in the document. If you are missing a component and notify me, it will cost you one point. If you are missing a component and do NOT tell me, it will cost you two points (i.e. minimum grade for this project is -22 points). If you have a component and do not include documentation of it, you lose the point. Also include in the document the description of your game mentioned above. 

You must also include in your PDF document a citation of every resource that you used (for programming/Unity, not for images or assets). Followed a tutorial? Give me the link and tell me what you used. Found some code on Stack Overflow? Tell me what and from where. Asked a friend for help? Note whom you asked and what they helped with. Use ChatGPT? Include both your prompt and its output. Failure to comply with this policy will result in a failing grade and a report to the collegeâ€™s Academic Integrity Officer.

Name your submission Last Name + First Name + name of game (e.g. Doe John Balloon Popper).

Please submit as a WebGL at itch.io game jam; link https://itch.io/jam/fall-2024-lab-submission. Please also submit (via Blackboard)  the PDF of documentation along with a link to the GitHub repository hosting the code. You must submit on both itch and Blackboard to get credit and you must have a GitHub repository of your code. 


(Note that the due date on the itch jam is later than the date here. The correct due date is December 7 at 11:59 PM and late submissions will be penalized.)
